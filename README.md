# Landscapes
Hobby project to practice graphics techniques through rendering landscapes based on real-world locations. Made with NVIDIA's [Donut](https://github.com/NVIDIA-RTX/Donut) framework.

## Requirements

Same as [Donut](https://github.com/NVIDIA-RTX/Donut):
- Windows or Linux (Windows recommended as only tested on Windows)
- CMake 3.10
- A C++17 Compiler
- A shader compiler (i.e. DXC for DX12)

## Build

1. Clone the repository **with all submodules**:

    `git clone --recursive https://github.com/jambuttenshaw/landscapes`

    If you forgot to clone with `--recursive`, then inside the cloned repo:
    `git submodule update --init --recursive`

2. Create a build folder inside `landscapes`:

    `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Use CMake to configure the build and generate project files:

    `cmake ..`

    OR use CMake GUI.
4. Build the solution generated by CMake in the build folder (e.g. in Visual Studio on Windows).
5. Run `landscapes` project from Visual Studio.

## Scene Formats

Landscapes uses the same [JSON-based scene layout files](https://github.com/NVIDIA-RTX/Donut/blob/main/doc/SceneFile.md) as [Donut](https://github.com/NVIDIA-RTX/Donut), with extensions for defining terrain objects.
